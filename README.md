# Hopfield Electrons

Hopfield Electrons is a deep learning model for ab initio quantum chemistry and physics. Quantum neural networks have been shown to deliver exceptional performance as surrogate models for problems in many-body quantum systems.

This model combines efficient equivariant methods for positional data using the e3nn package and continuous Hopfield networks, while enforcing anti-symmetric solutions in line with Fermionic solutions. The package is developed with JAX.
