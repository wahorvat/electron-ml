# Hopfield Electrons

Hopfield Electrons is a deep learning model for quantum chemistry and physics. Quantum neural networks have been shown to deliver exceptional performance as surrogate models for problems in many-body quantum systems.

This model combines efficient equivariant methods for positional data and continuous Hopfield networks, while enforcing anti-symmetric solutions in line with Fermionic solutions.
